# Deployment

## Web Requirements

- PHP 8.5 with required Laravel extensions including PDO SQLite/SQLite3, Mbstring, OpenSSL, JSON, Fileinfo, Tokenizer, XML, Ctype, and Curl as used by installed packages.
- Composer 2, Node 22, and npm for reproducible asset builds.
- A local SQLite-compatible persistent filesystem for the database/WAL/SHM and private writable storage for cache, sessions, queue, uploads, and backups.
- HTTPS, `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, a unique `APP_KEY`, secure cookie/session configuration, correct `APP_URL`, mail configuration where invitations/reminders are enabled, and no demo credentials.

## Release Sequence

```bash
composer install --no-dev --classmap-authoritative --no-interaction
npm ci
npm run build
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan app:database-health
```

Do not run `db:seed` in production unless an explicitly reviewed idempotent reference seeder is selected; never run the full demo `DatabaseSeeder` or `migrate:fresh`. Keep a consistent external backup before migrations, deploy populated-safe migrations, and retain the previous release for rollback. Rollback must account for code/schema compatibility; do not blindly run destructive down migrations.

Configure the scheduler and, when reminder delivery is queued, a supervised bounded database queue worker. Monitor application logs, failed jobs, disk space, SQLite health, backup results, and scheduler freshness.

## NativePHP Mobile

NativePHP uses an embedded PHP 8.4 runtime upstream, even when web/dev uses PHP 8.5. Composer and application syntax must retain mobile compatibility until NativePHP publishes 8.5. Build/release requires official NativePHP tools, configured app ID/version/signing, min Android SDK 31 for Android 12, target/compile SDK values from config, a production frontend build, and real-device testing before store submission.

The verified development artifact was built with NativePHP Mobile 4.2 and Gradle 8.14.5. `aapt` reported package `com.goleaf.xiaomimimo`, minSdk 31, targetSdk 36. Production releases must replace debug signing and `DEBUG` version metadata through protected CI/release configuration.

Do not commit signing keys, provisioning profiles, production tokens, or generated local build artifacts. Verify the packaged manifest/runtime contract after every NativePHP major update.
